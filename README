== rogg - Raw Ogg file library and utilities ==

rogg is a small library I wrote for manipulating Ogg streams in memory.

This makes it convenient to write certain quick scripts for checking
and fixing simple bitstream errors in mmap()'d files. 

Examples:

  rogg_theora will dump and optionally set the frame rate, the
  pixel aspect ratio and the crop rectangle stored in an Ogg
  Theora stream.

  rogg_eosfix will set the end_of_stream flag on the last page
  of a stream. This is often unset in downloads truncated from
  an icecast stream.

  rogg_crcfix will reset the CRCs on all the Ogg pages in a stream.
  This is mostly useful if the stream has been edited with some
  non-aware tool.

  rogg_pagedump dumps some basic header information for each page
  in a stream.

  rogg_serial changes the serial number of a logical ogg stream.

  rogg_kate will dump and optionally set the language, category,
  and original canvas size stored in an Ogg Kate stream.

  rogg_granule will adjust non-zero and non-minus1 granule positions
  by the given amount, which is useful to chop off individual PCM
  samples at the beginnig of Vorbis streams.
